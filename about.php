                            <p><h6>Pritilata was born in a middle-class Vaidya Brahmin family on 5 May 1911 in Dhalghat village in Patiya upazila of Chittagong (now in Bangladesh).She was a Bengali revolutionary nationalist. After completing her education in Chittagong, she attended the Bethune College in Calcutta. Pritilata graduated in Philosophy with distinction.After a brief stint as a school teacher, Pritilata joined a revolutionary group headed by Surya Sen. She led a 15 man team of revolutionaries in a 1932 attack on the Pahartali European Club, which had a sign board that read "Dogs and Indians not allowed". The revolutionaries torched the club and were later caught by the British police. To avoid getting arrested, Pritilata consumed cyanide and died .</h6></p>

                            <p><h6>Surya Sen was a Bengali independence activist who remembered for his daring raid on the British armoury in Chittagong (now in Bangladesh) in 1930. A school teacher, revered by all as ‘Masterda’, an honorific translating to “a teacher and an elder brother”, he was deeply influenced by nationalist ideals even as a student. Even though the Chittagong Armoury raid was largely unsuccessful, it demonstrated to the British the extent of the public anger against them. A brilliant strategist and charismatic leader, he was able to prevail upon the youth and ladies, in particular, to join the Indian independence movement. Betrayed, Surya Sen was arrested, subjected to appalling torture, and then executed by the British who were unable to tame his nationalistic spirit.
