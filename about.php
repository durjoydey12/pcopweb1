                            <p><h6>Pritilata Waddedar (5 May 1911 – 24 September 1932)[1][2] was an Indian revolutionary nationalist from the Indian subcontinent who was influential in the Indian independence movement.[3][4] After completing her education in Chittagong and Dhaka, she attended Bethune College in Kolkata. She graduated in philosophy with distinction and became a school teacher. She is praised as "Bengal's first woman martyr".[5][6]

Pritilata joined a revolutionary group headed by Surya Sen. She is known for leading fifteen revolutionaries in the 1932 armed attack[7] on the Pahartali European Club,[8][9] during which one person was killed and eleven injured. The revolutionaries torched the club and were later caught by the colonial police. To escape arrest, Pritilata committed suicide by cyanide.[10]</h6></p>

                            <p><h6>Surya Sen was a Bengali independence activist who remembered for his daring raid on the British armoury in Chittagong (now in Bangladesh) in 1930. A school teacher, revered by all as ‘Masterda’, an honorific translating to “a teacher and an elder brother”, he was deeply influenced by nationalist ideals even as a student. Even though the Chittagong Armoury raid was largely unsuccessful, it demonstrated to the British the extent of the public anger against them. A brilliant strategist and charismatic leader, he was able to prevail upon the youth and ladies, in particular, to join the Indian independence movement. Betrayed, Surya Sen was arrested, subjected to appalling torture, and then executed by the British who were unable to tame his nationalistic spirit.
